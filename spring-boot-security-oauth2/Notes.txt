Pre-Requisites:
GCP Account is required.
Follow the below process:
To obtain client credentials for Google OAuth2 authentication, head on over to the Google API Console – section “Credentials”.
Here we'll create credentials of type “OAuth2 Client ID” for our web application. This results in Google setting up a client id and secret for us.
We also have to configure an authorized redirect URI in the Google Console, which is the path that users will be redirected to after they successfully login with Google.
By default, Spring Boot configures this redirect URI as /login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}. Therefore, for Google we'll add the URI:

http://localhost:8081/login/oauth2/code/google
